# Data Structures in C++


This repository contains the activities and exercises perfomed in the discipline of ***Data Structures I***
of the semester 2017.2 and ***Data Structures II*** of the bachareled in Information Technology (**UFRN**). In addition, it contains the other projects made by this author,
carefully documented. Therefore, the projects are organized in the following folders:

- Dictionary
- HashTable
- LinkedList
- Vector

## What is data structure?



## Data Structures implemented

Below is the process in the implementation of the data structures

- [X] Dictionary

> Methods
>> - [X] Remove
>> - [X] Insert
>> - [X] Sucessor
>> - [X] Predecessor
>> - [X] Min
>> - [X] Max

- [X] HashTable
- [X] LinkedList
- [X] Vector
- [ ] BinarySearchTree
- [ ] Stack
- [ ] Queue
- [ ] Deque
- [ ] Set

## Minimum requirements

Compilador C++ 11 (**g++**), GNU debugger (**GDB**), Valgrind e Doxygen.
	
	Obs.: Para usuários Linux, tanto o g++ quanto o gdb são ambos nativo, faltando apenas instalar o Doxygen  
	e o Valgrind. Porém, caso deseje usar o gdb no Windows será necessário instalar o MinGW. 

Download Doxygen (**UBUNTU**):

```$ sudo apt-get install doxygen``` 

Download Valgrind (**UBUNTU**):

```sudo apt-get install valgrind```
